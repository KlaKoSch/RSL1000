# RSL1000
Here you find actual documentation and sources for the Arrow/Trenz RSL1000 module.

## Description
The RSL1000 is a small module based on OnSemi RSL10 using Arduino MKR form factor.<br>
It was developed by Arrow and Trenz Electronics and is available at<br>
https://www.arrow.com/en/products/rsl1000/trenz-electronic-gmbh<br>

Because there is the wrong RSL1000 pinout in older documents I add here a corrected version of:<br>
<b>RSL1000 - Getting Started (V1.2 from August 2021).</b><br>

In addition I wrote a new document with more details of RSL1000:<br>
<b>Using RSL1000 (V1.0)</b><br>
It includes also the corrected pinout and description of some demo programs:<br>
* Blinky - adaption of RSL10 demo<br>
* hardware-selftest - a demonstration of (RGB) LEDs<br>
* RSL1000 - how to use all 4 I2C devices on the RSL1000<br>
